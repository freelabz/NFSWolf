//! Credential escalation ladder shared by every subcommand that performs
//! NFS operations.
//!
//! When the server returns NFS3ERR_ACCES, callers retry through a
//! consistent sequence of (uid, gid) pairs: the file owner first, then
//! root, then well-known service accounts. Centralising the order means
//! the shell, the FUSE adapter, and the offensive subcommands all walk
//! the same ladder, so behaviour is predictable across surfaces.

/// Build the credential escalation ladder for a failed NFS operation.
///
/// `caller` is the (uid, gid) that was rejected.
/// `owner` is the file/directory owner from GETATTR, if available.
///
/// Priority:
///   1. (owner_uid, owner_gid)  -- file owner; works on uid-protected files
///   2. (caller_uid, owner_gid) -- caller claiming the file group; works for
///      group-readable files when root is squashed (e.g. chrony gid=989)
///   3. (0, 0)                  -- root, works when export has no_root_squash
///   4. Common service UIDs (nobody, 1000, www-data, mysql, postgres)
///
/// Used by the shell (ls, cd, cat), the FUSE mount, and the offensive
/// subcommands (escape, brute-handle, uid-spray) so every NFS operation
/// gets the same automatic privilege escalation.
/// The credential ladder: identities to try, in priority order.
///
/// AUTH_SYS lets a client assert any identity, so when an operation is refused
/// the useful next move is to try a different one. This returns the candidates
/// in priority order; the caller attempts each until one is accepted.
///
/// The order is not arbitrary. The file's own owner comes first because it is
/// the identity most likely to be permitted; then the caller's UID paired with
/// the file's group, which catches group-readable files; then root, which a
/// `no_root_squash` export honours; then the service accounts that own most
/// interesting files on a typical host.
///
/// Two related capabilities live elsewhere rather than here. Exhaustive
/// UID/GID brute force is the `uid-spray` subcommand, because it is loud enough
/// to be an explicit operator decision rather than an automatic fallback. The
/// NFSv2 downgrade -- some servers apply `root_squash` on their v3 path but not
/// their v2 one -- is not implemented; see the backlog.

/// identity that is neither the owner nor in the owning group has no path to
/// the file at all, and every service-account rung below is provably wasted
/// RPC. Root still gets its rung, because a `no_root_squash` export bypasses
