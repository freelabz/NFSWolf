//! NFSv4 for nfswolf: both direct (probe) and pooled (shell) clients.
//!
//! The wire types live in `nfs_v4`; this module provides:
//!
//! - `Nfs4DirectClient` (in `compound.rs`): pool-free, single-connection client
//!   for scanner/analyzer probes. Manages its own TCP socket, proxy tunnelling,
//!   and stealth pacing.
//!
//! - `Nfs4Client` (type alias below): the library client bound to
//!   `PooledTransport`, giving the v4 shell circuit breaking, connection reuse,
//!   stealth pacing, and zero-round-trip credential swaps -- the same policy the
//!   v2 and v3 shells use.
//!
//! NFSv4.0 has no session state (v4.1 adds sessions via RFC 8881), so each
//! COMPOUND is independent and pooling is safe. The stateful half of the
//! protocol (OPEN, CLOSE, LOCK, delegations) is out of scope.
//!
//! Even when a server primarily serves NFSv3, the v4 endpoint is often active
//! on the same port (2049) and answers questions v3 cannot:
//!
//! - SECINFO reports the authentication flavors a directory actually accepts,
//!   per-directory rather than per-export.
//! - The pseudo-filesystem exposes export boundaries via fsid changes.
//! - READDIR still works when the v3 endpoint is filtered.
//!
//! Only the read-only subset is implemented. The stateful half of the protocol
//! -- OPEN, CLOSE, LOCK, delegations, and the v4.1 session machinery -- is out
//! of scope; see `nfs_v4` for the operations that are covered.
