//! NFSv3 for nfswolf: the library client, bound to the pooled transport.
//!
//! `nfswolf-nfs3` owns the protocol; `PooledTransport` owns the policy. This
//! module is only the seam between them, which is why it is a type alias rather
//! than a wrapper: the 22 procedure methods that used to live here each
//! repeated the same six lines of pool checkout, breaker check, and timeout
//! plumbing. That plumbing now exists once, in `proto::transport`.

/// sites already use.
