/// Three layers of defence, because several fields (evidence preview, export
/// paths, titles) carry data straight from an untrusted NFS server:
///   0. Control-byte neutralization. A CSV is routinely viewed with cat/less/grep
///      in a terminal, so ANSI/terminal escape sequences in server data would
///      execute and rewrite the screen. The shared `sanitize_control` helper
///      rewrites every C0/C1/DEL byte and bidi/zero-width codepoint to a printable
///      token first, matching the txt/console renderers.
///   1. Formula-injection guard. A cell beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, TAB
///      or CR is treated as a formula by Excel/LibreOffice/Sheets on open, which
///      can exfiltrate data or trigger DDE. Prefixing such a value with a single
///      quote forces the spreadsheet to render it as literal text.
///   2. RFC 4180 quoting. The (possibly guarded) value is always wrapped in
///      double-quotes with embedded quotes doubled, so commas, quotes and
///      newlines inside the field cannot break the row/column structure.
